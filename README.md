# Badwars
## What is Badwars?
This is a Minecraft Server plugin for Minecraft version 1.18.1, for Java version 17. 

Using this plugin will enable your Minecraft Spigot/Paper server to run a game known as "Bedwars". (But we gave it a new name)

Every team has a block in their home base they have to protect. The goal is to destroy the enemies block, which is often a bed, thus the name. 
If you die in the game you can respawn, for an unlimited number of times until your bed has been destroyed. After that, you are living your final life. 

Each team has sources of different materials that appear on their island, while there is one most valuable resource only available in the island in the middle. With the resources you can buy items to get a hand of the middle island, to kill enemies or to quicker get to the enemies bed in order to destroy it.
